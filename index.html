					<h2>"Deeply-Held Assumptions"</h2>
					<blockquote class="fragment" style="font-size:32px;">[A]ntislavery activists invited their audiences to "read" those bodies in a way not dissimilar to the way slaves' bodies were read at slave markets in the South. (Boster 2)</blockquote>
					<blockquote class="fragment" style="font-size:32px;">[S]laves with disabilities threatened the delicate illusion of control and stability that white authority figures had constructed but also forced them to confront their own deeply-held assumptions about race, deviance, and defect. (Boster 3)</blockquote>
				</section>
                <section>
					<h2>"Active Participants"</h2>
					<blockquote class="fragment" style="font-size:34px;">[S]laves (and their bodies) actively participated in disabilty meaning-making projects (Boster 3)</blockquote>
					<blockquote class="fragment" style="font-size:34px;">[S]laves themselves... were not mere bystanders in discourse about unsoundness; they were active participants in the construction of meaning around disability and recognized that prevalent assumptions about disability could be advantageous in bondage. (Boster 4)</blockquote>
				</section>
                <section>
					<h2>Puar and Productive Maiming</h2>
					<blockquote class="fragment">I argue that the Israeli state manifests an <i>implicit</i> "right to maim" and debilitate Palestinian bodies and environments as a form of biopolitical control.</blockquote>
					<blockquote class="fragment">I note that the policy of maiming is a productive one, through the profitability of what I call a speculative rehabilitative economy. (128)</blockquote>
				</section>
                <section>
					<h2>Disability and the Slave Narrative</h2>
					<blockquote>The connection between racial identity and disability identity is also apparent in primary evidence; for instance, there was a close connection between ex-slave narratives and disability narratives (Wilson 9)</blockquote>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Whites Reading the Non-White Body</h2>
					<blockquote><p>As they neared the village, they heard the merry shouts of children gathered around the schoolroom, awaiting the coming of their teacher.</p><p>"Hallo!" screamed one, "Black, white, and yeller!" "Black, white, and yeller," echoed a dozen voices. (Wilson 20-21)</blockquote>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Frado Reading (or Not) Samuel's Back</h2>
					<blockquote class="fragment">He was a fine, straight negro, whose back showed no marks of the lash, erect as if it never crouched beneath a burden (Wilson 127)</blockquote>
                    <blockquote class="fragment">He left her to her fate&mdash;embarked at sea, with the disclosure that he had never seen the South, and that his illiterate harangues were humbugs for hungry abolitionists. (Wilson 127-28)</blockquote>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Jim's Illness</h2>
					<blockquote>A few years, and a severe cough and pain in his side compelled him to be an idler for weeks together... He became the victim of consumption. (Wilson 14-15)</blockquote>
				</section>
                <section>
					<h2>Frado's Illness</h2>
					<blockquote>Nig was taken sick! What could be done The <i>work</i>, certainly, but not by Miss Mary. So Nig would work while she could remain erect, then sink down upon the floor, or a chair, till she could rally for a fresh effort. Mary would look in upon her, chide her for her laziness, threaten to tell her mother... [Frado] attempted to drag her weary limbs along, using the broom as support. (Wilson 63-64)</blockquote>

					<h2>Formal Contradictions in Tone</h2>
					<blockquote class="fragment">As [Meg] merged into womanhood, unprotected, uncherished, uncared for, there fell on her ear the music of love, awakening an intensity of emotion long dormant. (Wilson 5)</blockquote>

					<h2>Imagining Wilson's Authorial Choices</i></h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Choose an aspect of the text that confuses you or seems to contradict the narrative.</li>
                        <li>Find a passage from the text which can be used to represent this aspect of the text.</li>
                        <li>Use one theorist we have read in this class to come up with one explanation for this confusing or contradictory aspect of the text. In what way can we understand this aspect of the text as having been an explicit choice by the author (or someone else who had a hand in its publication)?</li>
